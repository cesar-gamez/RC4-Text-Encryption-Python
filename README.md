# ARC4-Text-Encryption-Python
A simple text encryption demo using the ARC4 algorithm. The program generates a random string of ASCII characters between length 50 and 99 for the key. The user then inputs any string they want, and the program outputs the encrypted text in HEX, along with the generated encryption key.
